# Basic auth (only one user allowed) provides basic protection of all node paths. You will probably want to use something 
# more flexible, with a fine grained control, such as the node-red-contrib-auth. Using the build-in single-user basic auth
# and node-red-contrib-auth will most likely cause the latter to fail. If you want to use node-red-contrib-auth, just set
# the two values below to empty strings.
# NOTE that basic authentication is only secure if traffic is forced over https. While Node-red has the ability to run over
# https only, any sane installation should have a propper reverse proxy infront of it.
